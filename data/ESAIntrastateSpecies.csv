1,Alabama,131,"The eastern indigo snake is the longest snake native to the United States. Dry, sandy oak and pine forests are important for this species and Defenders is working across the country to protect both federal and private lands that are home to these snakes. "
2,Alaska,9,"Polar bears are the largest living carnivores on Earth. Their survival is threatened by loss of habitat and sea ice from human disturbance and climate change. Defenders is currently working to save the most important ￼denning habitat for the Southern Beaufort Sea population, found in￼ Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, from oil drilling."
3,Arizona,64,The jaguar is the largest cat in the Americas. Their numbers are declining because of habitat destruction and poaching. Defenders played a key role in establishing the Northern Jaguar Reserve in Mexico and continues to work to return this majestic cat to its historic range in the United States. 
4,Arkansas,36,"Sometimes known as the ""snot otter,"" the hellbender is North America's largest salamander. Ore and gravel mining have lowered the water quality in their river habitats. Defenders launched the Southeastern Hellbender Conservation Initiative (SEHCI) working with private landowners for habitat restoration."
5,California,296,"When the last free-flying condor was taken into captivity in 1987, the population was at an all-time low of 22 individuals. Condors were reintroduced into the wild in 1991, and their population has now grown to over 400. Defenders has worked with the California legislature to phase out lead ammunition to reduce lead poisoning - the number one cause of death in adult condors."
6,Colorado,34,Gunnison sage grouse males try to attract a mate by fluttering their wings and creating popping sounds from two air sacs on their chest. This grouse has become one of the most endangered birds in North America as a result of habitat loss and degradation. Defenders is heavily engaged in initiatives to ensure the protection of this grouse and the sagebrush habitat it depends on.
7,Connecticut,12,"Roseate terns found in northeastern North America tend to nest in colonies with the more aggressive common tern, providing them protection from predators. Roseate tern researchers often need to wear head protection due to the common terns’ aggression. Their numbers have decreased in some regions due to increased competition and predation by gulls. "
8,Delaware,11,"Each year the red knot travels more than 9,000 miles from breeding to wintering grounds - that's over 3 coast-to-coast U.S. road trips! In the past decade, the population has dropped 80%. Defenders was part of the successful fight to list the species under the ESA."
9,District of Columbia,2,"This aquatic crustacean resembles a very tiny shrimp – about the size of your little fingernail!  But this doesn't make the amphipod any less important. As the only federally endangered species that lives exclusively in Washington D.C., it is an important indicator about the health of local creeks."
10,Florida,134,"The panther is recognized as Florida's official state animal and as one of the most endangered mammals in the country. Defenders lobbied for the panther's listing almost 50 years ago and now continues to fight to protect large, interconnected tracts of wild land for their survival."
11,Georgia,76,"The red-cockaded woodpecker is the only woodpecker to create hollows in living pine trees, taking up to two years to dig a single home. Logging decimated their population, but their numbers have slowly improved since listing in 1973. Defenders is fighting Trump administration attempts to reduce or eliminate protections for the species."
12,Hawaii,503,"Thought to be extinct, a small colony of three H. woodii plants was discovered in April 2019 during a drone flight over Kauai's Kalalau Valley cliffs. Like other endangered native Hawaiian species, it faces threats from invasive plants, introduced animals, and rock slides. This rediscovery brings new hope and a reminder that every individual counts in preventing extinction."
13,Idaho,15,"Gray wolves were eradicated from the lower 48 states by the mid-1900s, and, despite substantial gains since reintroduction to Idaho and Yellowstone National Park in 1995, are still far from their historic numbers. Defenders pioneers practical solutions to enhance coexistence between wolves and humans, such as nonlethal deterrents to deter wolves from preying on livestock. Defenders also monitors legislatures and wildlife agencies for potential threats to wolf recovery."
14,Illinois,34,"In 2017, the rusty patched bumble bee – which builds its nests underground in wetlands, fields and grasslands – was the first bee native to mainland United States to be listed as endangered under the ESA.  With the rapid spread of bee diseases and parasites and potent insecticides impacting these important pollinators, 75% of our crops and many wild plant species may suffer. "
15,Indiana,27,The Indiana bat was part of the first group of species listed under the predecessor of the ESA in 1967. It is particularly vulnerable to habitat destruction and a fungal disease called white-nose syndrome. Defenders is working with university researchers and state and federal agencies to secure federal funding for white-nose syndrome research and education. 
16,Iowa,19,"Northern long-eared bats populations have declined up to 99% in the northeast. Wind energy is one of the fastest-growing industries globally, essential for transitioning to renewable energy sources. However, industrial wind turbines negatively impact bats like the northern long-eared that roost in trees and/or migrate. Defenders’ is engaged across the country to promote responsible wind energy, advocating for safer turbine operation and innovative bat-deterrent technology."
17,Kansas,17,"The Topeka shiner lives primarily in small prairie streams and oxbow ponds containing clear, clean water. Bringing back shiners will involve providing new habitat by restoring water quality. Defenders has stood up against the Trump administration's attempts to weaken national water quality standards."
18,Kentucky,47,"The Kentucky cave shrimp is tiny, eyeless and translucent, and found only in the Mammoth Cave area. They were thought to be extinct in 1970, but the population was rediscovered after the passing of the Clean Water Act. Defenders’ work addresses growing concerns about water pollution and habitat quality for this and other listed species."
19,Louisiana,24,"Kemp’s ridley sea turtle is the rarest species of sea turtle. Outside of nesting locations in Mexico, the major habitat for Kemp's ridleys is the nearshore waters of the northern Gulf of Mexico. Populations were devastated due to egg harvesting. Defenders helps improve coastal-construction policies to protect the nesting habitat and beach access for future sea turtles. "
20,Maine,12,"With only 90 breeding females left, each individual is critical to the survival of the North Atlantic right whale. Defenders is building support in Congress to enact the SAVE Right Whales Act, to provide much-needed funding to develop and deploy technologies to protect the species from fishing entanglements and vessel strikes."
21,Maryland,20,"The bog turtle lives in mountain bogs, one of the rarest habitats on Earth: only 500 acres of mountain bogs remain, and area smaller than Central Park in NYC! Defenders is a member of the Bog Learning Network, which is focused on protecting and restoring mountain bogs and their native species."
22,Massachusetts,17,"The Plymouth redbelly turtle was the first freshwater turtle in the U.S. to be listed as endangered. The turtle lives in the pinelands of Massachusetts and gets its name from its reddish undershell. Residential development leads to the loss of nesting and basking habitat for these turtles. Defenders supports efforts similar to the Massachusetts ""head start"" programs which help raise turtle hatchlings until they are big and strong enough to survive on their own."
23,Michigan,26,The Michigan monkey flower is the only plant endemic to the state of Michigan. It is a semi-aquatic species that produces clumps of stems - clumps can contain hundreds of stems all belonging to a single individual! Much of the monkey-flower’s habitat along the shorelines of the Great Lakes has been lost to recreational damage and residential development. 
24,Minnesota,19,"Lynx are mysterious animals that have earned the nickname ""shadow of the forest"". The habitat of the lynx and its primary prey, the snowshoe hare, will likely decrease in extent because of climate change, harming lynx populations. Defenders petitioned for the lynx to be listed under the ESA and supports lynx reintroduction efforts."
25,Mississippi,50,"Dusky gopher frogs spend most of their lives underground in burrows created by gopher tortoises. In 2018, a question over designated critical habitat for the frog became the first ESA case to go to the Supreme Court in nearly a decade. Defenders was there in support of the ESA and critical habitat and will continue to fight for at-risk species."
26,Missouri,38,"The Ozark cave fish has no need for eyes because it lives in dark caves. Instead, it uses other senses to detect motion and locate food such as plankton, crayfish, salamander larvae, and bat guano (poop!). Mining has contaminated the waters that the cavefish depend on, polluting their habitat and food sources. Defenders has stood up to the Trump administration's attempts to weaken national water quality standards."
27,Montana,15,"Pallid sturgeon ancestors date back 78 million years! But dam building in the 1900s disrupted the rivers’ natural flow, temperature, and oxygen levels, which destroyed and cut off access to much of the sturgeon’s spawning grounds. Defenders fights for aquatic connectivity in the Yellowstone River and throughout the sturgeon's range."
28,Nebraska,15,"The American burying beetle is a large carrion beetle, storing carcasses underground for a future snack and returning the critical nutrients back to the soil. The beetle is negatively impacted by increasing pesticide use. Defenders works to strengthen protections for endangered and threatened species against potentially harmful pesticides."
29,Nevada,40,"To beat the desert heat, desert tortoises dig underground burrows. Tunnels can be up to 32 feet long and can be shared by as many as 25 tortoises! Defenders helped to get the desert tortoise federally listed as a threatened species in 1990 and continues to oppose threats such as excessive and improper livestock grazing, unmanaged off-road vehicle use, and poorly sited renewable energy development."
30,New Hampshire,12,"Jesup’s milkvetch clings by its small roots to crevices in the steep rock cliffs along the Connecticut River. It withstands summer heat and drought, winter ice, and spring flooding. Its population has doubled since listing in 1987, but it is still harmed by competing invasive species. Defenders supports invasive species removal programs and advocates for policies that require screening and inspection before plants and animals enter the country."
31,New Jersey,16,"The northeastern beach tiger beetle is a tiny, sand-colored beetle that lives on sandy beaches throughout the northeast and mid-Atlantic. The major threat they face is habitat loss due to development, population growth and increased beach use. Defenders works to preserve beaches, promote responsible use of beach habitat, and organize beach clean-ups."
32,New Mexico,53,"Mexican gray wolves were wiped out by the mid-1970s. In 1998, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, led by Jamie Rappaport Clark (now president of Defenders of Wildlife), released 11 Mexican gray wolves back into the wild. Defenders supports additional releases of wolves and collaborations between American and Mexican biologists."
33,New York,24,"Did you know that nearly half of the recorded animal extinctions in the past 500 years are mollusks like snails, mussels, and octopuses? Researchers estimate there are only 150 individuals left of the Chittenango amber ovate snail. Defenders supports captive breeding programs, like the one for the amber snail, that help to restore wild populations."
34,North Carolina,66,"Uniquely ""All-American,"" the red wolf's entire historical range was within what is now the United States. It has lost a greater percentage of its historical territory than any other large carnivore. Defenders leads grassroots outreach efforts in North Carolina to increase awareness of the critical situation for wild red wolves."
35,North Dakota,9,"Standing nearly five feet tall, whooping cranes are one of America's largest wading birds, but also one of its most endangered animals with just three wild crane populations left. Habitat management involves water control, reducing human disturbance, and maintaining agricultural fields as food sources. They often spend winters at the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge in Texas – one of the 563 refuges that Defenders of Wildlife fights to protect."
36,Ohio,28,"Red-bellied water snakes spend more time on land than most other species of water snakes, which makes them particularly vulnerable to habitat fragmentation by roads and other developments. Defenders is working to protect and enhance wetland habitat for water snakes and other wildlife."
37,Oklahoma,20,Leopard darters typically live less than two years and spawn only once in their lifetime. The greatest threat to the survival of the species is the loss of habitat due to the construction of dams and reservoirs. Defenders fights for aquatic habitat quality and connectivity throughout the darter's range.
38,Oregon,57,"Native Americans in the area historically depended on suckers as an important source of protein in the spring, when other sources of food became depleted. However, poor water quality has reduced the availability of suitable Lost River sucker habitat and has resulted in major fish mortality. Defenders has stood up against the Trump administration's attempts to weaken national water quality standards."
39,Pennsylvania,17,"Because it is not showy and not easily identified, little is known about the life history of the northeastern bulrush. Habitat degradation and destruction from human development and ATV usage is the primary threat to the species. Defenders works to create partnerships among the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, state agencies, nongovernmental organizations and private landowners to help protect species like the northeastern bulrush."
40,Rhode Island,9,"True to its name, the piping plover’s call sounds like a pair notes blown on a very small flute: peep-oh, peep-oh. Many of the coastal beaches traditionally used by piping plovers for nesting have been lost to commercial, residential, and recreational developments. Defenders has fought to make sure that critical habitat is designated and protected for the plover."
41,South Carolina,37,"The loggerhead sea turtle is the largest of all hard-shelled turtle species, weighing as much as 1,000 pounds. Beaches in the southeastern United States host 90% of sea turtle nesting in the continental U.S. and the largest rookery of loggerhead nesting in the world. Defenders works to preserve nesting beaches and foraging areas, promote responsible lighting along nesting beaches, and organize beach clean-ups."
42,South Dakota,15,"The Powesheik skipperling may have been extirpated from much of its range just within the last 10 years. Pollinators like this are critical to the persistence of the prairie. Defenders works to ensure that Congress continues to support strong programs like the Farm Bill that maintains conservation funding, programs, and provisions that benefit both landowners and wildlife — including pollinators."
43,Tennessee,101,"The spotfin chub is endemic to the Tennessee River basin and feeds on water bugs along the bottom of the river. Major disturbances including dams, sedimentation, invasive species, and wide-ranging fish kills have contributed to population declines. Defenders supports efforts like the capture and relocation program that has helped to redistribute chubs across their former ranges."
44,Texas,102,"Ocelot kittens are born with gray coats and blue eyes that turn golden brown when they’re about three months old. The fur and pet trades decimated the population, and in the United States fewer than 60 ocelots remain. Defenders is working with partners to ensure habitat connectivity for isolated U.S. and Mexican populations."
45,Utah,42,"Scientists can identify individual wolverines by the unique color patterns on their face, neck, and chest. As climate change continues, wolverines could lose one-third of their U.S. range by 2050. Defenders and our colleagues have been fighting for two decades to federally protect wolverines in the lower 48 states. The species is still awaiting a listing decision."
46,Vermont,6,The mainstem of the Connecticut River in New Hampshire and Vermont is thought to have the largest remaining dwarf wedgemussel population. Agricultural run-off and increases in severe river flooding are major threats to the population and its habitat. Defenders is fighting for clean water protections throughout the country and bringing enforcement lawsuits against polluters.
47,Virginia,74,"This species is one of the largest cave-dwelling bats in the eastern U.S. This is not a migratory bat, but if disturbed, the entire colony may try to move to a new site. Bats are critically important to maintaining healthy ecosystems and Defenders is working in support of policies and management that address major disturbances."
48,Washington,48,"Southern resident orcas have vocalizations that are very different from any other orca population in the Pacific Northwest. Unfortunately, there are only about 73 individuals left. Populations of chinook salmon, their primary prey, have declined and resulted in orca starvation. Defenders advocates for salmon habitat restoration and promotes reduction in marine pollution.  "
49,West Virginia,29,Woodland salamanders like the Cheat Mountain salamander do not have lungs and must breathe through their skin. This species is threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation due to logging and development in the forests of the West Virginia highlands. Defenders plays a leading role in fighting to protect habitat for endangered species throughout the country. 
50,Wisconsin,25,"As caterpillars, the Karner blue butterfly only eats the leaves of the wild lupine. Development and a lack of natural disturbances, such as fire, is causing habitat loss and degradation for this species. A main focus of Defenders is protecting key habitat for endangered species throughout the country.  "
51,Wyoming,15,The black-footed ferret is the only species of ferret native to North America. Habitat loss and disease are large threats to this species. Defenders has helped reintroduce ferret populations and extend recovery sites across parts of the species’ historic range.
